The CHN-Tool recalculates the composition of elemental analysis (CHN) by taking possible impurities or solvents into account. Organic solvents are often found in the unit cell after crystallization. These can be easily included in the molecular formula with this tool and adjusted to the experimental elemental analysis data.
